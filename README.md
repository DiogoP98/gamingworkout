# gamingWorkout

Program description:

	In this program we made 4 games from the National Championship of Mathematical Games, so that students who are attending to this contest can practice and improve their gaming knowledge. This contest is a competition for children who are in the primary school up to secondary school where they play 1v1 board games.
	
	The 4 games are to be played against a bot, which is impletemented with Artificial Intelligence algorithms like Alpha-Beta and Monte Carlo Tree Search. In each game there is an option to choose the difficulty of the bot and if he player wants to be the first to play or not.
